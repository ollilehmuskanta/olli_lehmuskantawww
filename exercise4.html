Smartphones
    <p>
        Smartphones are a class of mobile phones and of multi-purpose mobile computing devices.
         They are distinguished from feature phones by their stronger hardware capabilities and extensive mobile operating systems,
          which facilitate wider software, internet (including web browsing[1] over mobile broadband),
           and multimedia functionality (including music, video, cameras, and gaming), alongside core phone functions such as voice calls and text messaging.
            Smartphones typically contain a number of metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) integrated circuit (IC) chips,
             include various sensors that can be leveraged by their software (such as a magnetometer, proximity sensors, barometer, gyroscope, or accelerometer),
              and support wireless communications protocols (such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or satellite navigation).
